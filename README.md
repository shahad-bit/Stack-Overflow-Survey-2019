## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. survey_results_public.zip in data folder should be unzipped before running the code.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I was interested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to answer the following questions related to career satisfaction.:

1. Are Developers satisfied with thier career?
2. Who are the most satisfied developers?
3. Is there is a significant relationship between compensation and career satisfaction?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one iPython notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The Data folder contains the survey data used by this analysis.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@tatoeer_37079/are-developers-satisfied-with-thier-career-7cb417214f45).
